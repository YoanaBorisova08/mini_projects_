# Pig game 🐷

A fun, interactive two-player dice game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Roll the dice, accumulate points, and try to beat your opponent! 🏆

🎮 Game Overview

Players take turns rolling a die.

Each roll adds the number to the player’s current score.

Rolling a 1 resets the current score and switches the turn to the other player.

Players can choose to Hold, adding their current score to their total score and passing the turn.

The first player to reach the winning score (default 25) wins the game!

Perfect for learning DOM manipulation, event handling, and game state management in JavaScript.
